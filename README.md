## üìã Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## üéì My process

### Personal Learning Goals

The goal for me with this project was learning about responsiveness and accessibility. In the previous projects I used a lot of fixed dimensions to make it look like toe design as much as possible. For this one I tried using none, but I still had to use it a couple of times. However, I tried to reduce that as much as possible.

I also made the mobile-version first. I read that this is common practice nowadays, so I wanted to try that as well.

I tried to make the files as clean as possible. Instead of BEM naming and a lot of divs's, I used pure selectors when availlable.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS
- JavaScript

### Continued development

I want to learn more about accessibility and how to implement it as good as possible in my markup and code. I will strart reading about it on [https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility)

For validation in forms, I need to learn about Regular expressions. HTML5 made it easier to check is an email-address is valid, but there are some much more reasons to check the input a user tries to submit. Especially when regarding to making sure the input does not contain malicious code, like something that can delete a database.

### Useful resources

- [Meta Tags](https://metatags.io/) - I used this very easy-to-use meta tag generator to help me with the meta tags for sharing the URL.

- [Am I Responsive?](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) - I used this webpage to make the screenshot, showing multiple devices.
